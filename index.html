        <p>Here's an analysis of the polar bear laying above this line of text. This polar bear is the definition of amazing. He's straight thugging out on the ice there and he's all stretched out. Comfy, you know? He's got this cute little pink mouth that will no doubt make all the ladies love him. Kind of makes you wonder if he's plushy. But I've heard polar bears actually aren't all that soft.And omg that black button nose. It's all shiny and glistening. And look at those paws. Literally don't even get me started.</p>
